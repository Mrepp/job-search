# Skill Development Workflow

A guide to systematically building skills for your career goals.

## Overview

This workflow helps you identify, prioritize, and develop skills needed for your target roles.

## Step 1: Identify Skill Gaps

### Run Skill Analysis

```
/skill-builder
```

This analyzes:
- Your current skills vs target role requirements
- Frequency of skills across saved jobs
- Priority ranking of gaps

### Review the Report

The skill map shows:

```
Priority Gaps

P0 - Critical (Address Now)
├── Kubernetes (0 → 2) - Required by 80% of jobs
└── System Design (2 → 3) - Required for Staff level

P1 - Important (Next Quarter)
├── Leadership (1 → 2) - Required for advancement
└── AWS (2 → 3) - Frequently requested

P2 - Nice to Have
└── Terraform (0 → 1) - Useful but learnable on job
```

### Understand Gap Types

**Technical Gaps:**
- Languages, frameworks, tools
- Measurable and certifiable
- Often faster to close

**Experience Gaps:**
- Years in role, domain expertise
- Harder to accelerate
- Comes with time and projects

**Soft Skill Gaps:**
- Leadership, communication
- Developed through practice
- Often underestimated

## Step 2: Prioritize Learning

### Apply the Priority Framework

**P0 - Critical:**
- Start immediately
- Dedicate significant time
- Block out for daily/weekly practice
- Target: Close in 1-3 months

**P1 - Important:**
- Start after P0 or in parallel
- Regular but less intensive
- Target: Close in 3-6 months

**P2 - Nice to Have:**
- Opportunistic learning
- Low-intensity background study
- Target: Over time as convenient

### Calculate Time Investment

Estimate hours needed per skill:

| Skill | Current | Target | Gap | Hours Needed |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|--------------|
| Kubernetes | 0 | 2 | 2 | 80-120 hours |
| System Design | 2 | 3 | 1 | 40-60 hours |
| Leadership | 1 | 2 | 1 | Ongoing practice |

### Create Weekly Schedule

Example: 10 hours/week budget

```
Monday-Friday:
- 30 min morning: System design reading
- 30 min evening: Kubernetes course

Saturday:
- 2 hours: Kubernetes hands-on lab

Sunday:
- 2 hours: Practice project work
```

## Step 3: Select Resources

### For Each Skill, Choose:

**1. Primary Learning Resource**
- Comprehensive course or book
- Structured curriculum
- Takes you from current to target level

**2. Practice Environment**
- Hands-on labs
- Personal projects
- Real work applications

**3. Assessment Method**
- Certification exam
- Mock interviews
- Project completion

### Resource Quality Checklist

- [ ] Recent (within 2 years for tech)
- [ ] Well-reviewed (4.5+ stars)
- [ ] Includes practice exercises
- [ ] Appropriate for your level
- [ ] Reasonable time commitment

### Example Resource Plan

**Kubernetes (0 → 2)**

Primary:
- Course: "Kubernetes for Developers" (Linux Foundation)
- Time: 30 hours
- Cost: $299

Practice:
- Lab: KodeKloud playground
- Project: Deploy personal app to Minikube, then EKS

Assessment:
- Certification: CKA or CKD
- Milestone: Pass practice exams at 80%+

## Step 4: Execute the Plan

### Learning Techniques

**For Conceptual Knowledge:**
- Read/watch actively (take notes)
- Teach concepts to others
- Create summary documents
- Connect to prior knowledge

**For Practical Skills:**
- Follow along with tutorials
- Build from scratch after learning
- Break things and fix them
- Apply to real projects

**For Soft Skills:**
- Seek opportunities to practice
- Ask for feedback
- Reflect on interactions
- Find a mentor

### Track Progress

Update your profile as you grow:

```
/personal-analysis
```

Adjust skill confidence when you:
- Complete a major learning resource
- Finish a significant project
- Pass a certification
- Apply skill successfully at work

### Maintain Momentum

**Daily:**
- Minimum viable progress (30 min)
- Keep streak going
- Log what you learned

**Weekly:**
- Longer focused session
- Hands-on practice
- Review week's progress

**Monthly:**
- Evaluate overall progress
- Adjust plan if needed
- Celebrate wins

## Step 5: Validate Skills

### Internal Validation

**Self-Assessment:**
- Can you explain concepts without notes?
- Can you solve problems independently?
- Do you feel comfortable in interviews?

**Project Completion:**
- Built something using the skill?
- Deployed to production?
- Handled real challenges?

### External Validation

**Certifications:**
- Industry-recognized credential
- Proves baseline competency
- Helps pass resume screens

**Peer Review:**
- Code review feedback
- Colleague opinions
- Mentor assessment

**Interview Performance:**
- Mock interview success
- Real interview feedback
- Job offers
