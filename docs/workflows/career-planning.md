## When to Use This Workflow

- Planning your next career move
- Evaluating promotion readiness
- Considering a career pivot
- Setting long-term career goals

## Step 1: Assess Your Current Position

### Update Your Profile

Ensure your profile is current:

```
/personal-analysis
```

Review:
- Are all skills accurately rated?

- Does current title reflect your role?

### Map Your Position

```
/find-position
```

This analyzes where you stand:
- Current level (junior/mid/senior/staff)
- Domain expertise
- Strengths and growth areas
- Readiness for advancement

## Step 2: Explore Career Paths

### Vertical Progression (Promotion)

```
/find-position staff software engineer
```

For each potential promotion:
- **Readiness score** - How close are you?
- **Key requirements** - What's needed?
- **Gap analysis** - What's missing?
- **Timeline** - How long to get ready?

### Lateral Moves (Same Level, New Domain)

```
/find-position platform engineer
/find-position solutions architect
```

Evaluate:
- Skill overlap with current role
- New skills required
- Career implications
- Market demand

### Management Track

```
/find-position engineering manager
```

Consider:
- Interest in people management
- Leadership experience
- IC vs management tradeoffs
- Reversibility

## Step 3: Analyze the Market

### Research Target Roles

For your top career paths:

```
/find-job-postings staff engineer remote
/find-job-postings engineering manager
```

Look at:
- What companies are hiring?
- What do they require?

- What's the demand level?

### Research Target Companies

```
/find-company "company known for promoting engineers"
```

Look for:
- Companies with clear career ladders
- Strong engineering culture
- Growth opportunities
- Track record of internal promotion

## Step 4: Identify Development Areas

### Run Skill Gap Analysis

```
/skill-builder
```

This aggregates requirements from:
- Your target positions
- Saved job postings
- Career tree analysis

### Prioritize Gaps

**P0 - Critical (Address Now)**
- Required for your target role
- Missing or at basic level
- High impact on advancement

**P1 - Important (This Year)**
- Strengthens candidacy
- Differentiator in market
- Builds toward future roles

**P2 - Nice to Have (Ongoing)**
- Complementary skills
- Future-proofing
- Interesting but not urgent

## Step 5: Create a Development Plan

### Short-Term (0-6 months)

Focus on P0 gaps:

1. **Learning goal** - What to achieve
2. **Resources** - Courses, books, projects
3. **Milestones** - How to measure progress
4. **Time commitment** - Hours per week

Example:
```
Goal: Improve system design to expert level
Resources: DDIA book, mock interviews
Milestones: Complete book, pass 3 mocks
Time: 5 hours/week for 3 months
```

### Medium-Term (6-18 months)

Build experience:
- Seek stretch projects at current job
- Take on leadership opportunities
- Demonstrate target-level behaviors
- Build visibility and reputation

### Long-Term (18+ months)

Position for advancement:

## Step 6: Track Progress

### Regular Reviews

Monthly:

- Log completed learning
- Note new experiences

Quarterly:
- Re-run career analysis
- Adjust plans based on progress
- Evaluate market changes

Annually:
- Full career review
- Reset goals
- Consider job market

### Update the Skill Map

As you develop:

```
/skill-builder
```

Watch for:
- Confidence level increases
- Gaps closing
- New priorities emerging
